# twinpanel
Step by step I will post here some code to build a function for different twin models with panel/longitudinal data. 
First, I will try to "twinify" the panel fixed-effects model ("Panel-FE", see. Bollen and Brand 2010 for a SEM parametrization of the model) and the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM), presented by Hamaker et al. (2015). 

For the paper by Bollen and Brand see [here](https://doi.org/10.1353/sof.2010.0072), for the Hamaker paper see [here](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0038889).
