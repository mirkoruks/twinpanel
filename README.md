# twinpanel
Step by step I will post here some code to build a function for different twin models with panel/longitudinal data. 
First, I will try to "twinify" the panel fixed-effects model ("Panel-FE", see. Bollen and Brand 2010 for a SEM parametrization of the model) and the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM), presented by Hamaker et al. (2015).
